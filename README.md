You have been tasked as a Developer to create an application for a bookshop. The
bookshop has a small cafe that serves drinks, a selection of foods, and a good selection of
bestselling books. The cafe also has a book delivery service, where they can deliver books
directly to their customerâ€™s door! The owners of the cafe have requested that an application be
built to showcase a list of their menu and book items. The application should have an option for
customers to choose their food and drinks items and/or books items. There should also be an
option for employees to update the menu/book items, update or add any specials, or view
customer details (so they know who, what, and where to send the items to!).
